# FX Market: Medium Run

<br>

Usually a 4-5 year range, where countries experience ebbs and flows of .hi-pink[business cycle] booms and busts.

--

During boom periods, incomes tick up, .hi-pink[aggregate demand rises] across consumers

--

Some of that spills over into .hi-pink[increased demand for imports].

--

This implies a greater need for foreign currency.

# FX Market: Short Run

# FX Market: Short Run


<br>

.hi-pink[What causes short run changes in ExR?]

--

* Interest rate adjustments, which can occur 4-5 times in a year.

--

* Speculation, driven by exogenous shocks to the state of the economy (e.g. political scandal in Brazil, discovery of natural gas deposits off Cypriot coast, COVID outbreak at Chinese ports)


<br>

This latter cohort contribute to a mechanism known as .hi-pink[price discovery] in exchange rates.


---

# FX Market: Short 

<br>

> Price discovery is the trial-and-error process of discovering the equilibrium price in a market. If speculators believe a currency is overvalued, they sell that currency, driving its value down. 

If correct, currency moves towards equilibrium and speculators are rewarded through arbitrage profits. 

--


If wrong, large losses are realized. This can often lead to bankruptcy if these risks were taken based on borrowed funds. 

--

.hi-pink[These stakes deliver a strong incentive to make the correct decision, bolstering the speed of market adjustments in the process.]


---


# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

.hi-pink[Interest Parity Condition]: Difference between the home and foreign interest rates should be equal to the expected change (appreciation or depreciation) of the exchange rate. 

--

<br>

$$i-i^* = \frac{\left(F-R\right)}{R}$$

<br>

where $i$ is the home interest rate, $i^*$ is the foreign interest rate, $F$ is expected future exchange rate and $R$ is the current exchange rate. 


---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

Suppose an investor has the choice to either invest locally or abroad in one-year bonds.

--

> X year bond: After maturing for X year, the bond is paid back to the investor in full principal amount and includes a yield of interest accrued for X year(x)

--

Respective rates of return are $i=0.03$ and $i^*=0.02$. Each payoff is in a different currency. 

--

Suppose the 1-year US bond has a price of 1000 USD.


---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

The bond's payoff is equal to 

$$\text{P}\times(1+i)^n$$

where $P$ is the principal amount invested, $i$ is the interest rate and $n$ represents the number of years the bond accrues interest for before maturing. 

--

$$\text{US bond} = 1000 \times (1.03)^1 = 1030 \  \text{USD}$$
--

.hi-pink[German bond requires careful thoughts].

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

Bond principal plus __2% interest__ is paid in euros. 

--

The dollar value of this investment choice depends on the .hi-pink[future exchange rate one year from now].

--

Suppose exchange rate today is __1.2 USD per EUR__. 

--

Investor can buy __833.33 EUR__ in exchange for __1000 USD__.

<br>

$$\text{EUR bond} = 833.33 \times (1.02)^1 = 850 \  \text{EUR}$$

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

To accurately compare the two choices, investor must .hi-pink[forecast the exchange rate] in one years time (F).

--

If $E(F)=1.3 \ \text{USD/EUR}$, implies expected foreign value of $850 \times 1.3 = 1105 \ \text{USD}$

--

US Bond worth $1030$, so foreign return of $1105$ is more profitable.

--

Expect return of foreign investment: $i' = \left[\frac{E(F)}{R}\times (1+i^*)\right]-1$

.hi-pink[Compare i and i' to decide investment!]


---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

To guarantee $E(F) = F$ is to remove uncertainty from the setting. 

--

Hedge against exchange rate risk by signing contracts on the .hi-pink[forward exchange rate market.]

--

Today's spot rate $R$ and market rate on one year exchanges $F$ indicate where market sees ExR moving in one year.

--

If $F>R$, the currency is expected to depreciate. 

--

If $F<R$, the currency is expected to appreciate. 

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

In our example, investors were willing to sell off US bonds in order to purchase foreign bonds. 

--

Funds will flow from the US to Germany, causing German money supply to rise. 

--

A greater money supply implies lower interest rates, so $i*$ falls.

--

Demand for German currency used to buy the bonds rises, so $R$ rises. 

--

Market moves towards interest rate parity $i - i^* = \frac{\left(F-R\right)}{R}$


---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

.hi-pink[What happens when F changes?]

The future dollar value of German bonds in USD changes too.

--

The scale and direction of the change dictate the choice investors make.

--

Let us return to our previous example to see this in action. 

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

```{r, out.width="85%",echo=FALSE}

tibble( `US bond, USD` = rep(1030, 13),
        `German bond, EUR` = rep(850, 13),
        `F (USD per EUR)` = seq(0.7,1.9,0.1),
        `German bond, USD` = `German bond, EUR`*`F (USD per EUR)`,
        `Purchase` = ifelse(`German bond, USD`>`US bond, USD`, "German", "US")) %>%
  kbl() %>% kable_styling(font_size=14)

```

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

Suppose $i<i^*$ and $F<R$. US yields are lower and world expects USD to appreciate.  

--

Fed decides to set $i$ equal to $i^*$. Increased returns on US bonds .hi-pink[(Foreign Reserves rise)]. 

--

Implies US foreign currency supply increases _(shifts right)_ from $S1$ to $S2$. 

--

Demand for foreign bonds falls, shifts demand down _(shifts left)_ from $D1$ to $D2$.

--

Think of GBP market, expect USD to .hi-pink[appreciate] under these conditions. 

---

# FX Market: Interest Parity

<br>

These mechanisms playout somewhat like a .hi-pink[self-fulfilling prophecy].

--

If investors think USD will depreciate in future, $F$ rises. 

--

This causes return on foreign bonds to improve, causing demand on foreign currency to rise and the dollar's spot rate $R$ depreciates. 


--

<br>

.hi-pink[A change in expectations about future exchange rates can lead to a similar change in the spot rate].


---

# FX Market: Interest Parity


<br>

We can think about the market playing out in two manners:

--

1) Covered interest parity (CIP)

> Assume the investor has .hi-pink[perfect foresight] such that $E(F)=F$.


--

2) Uncovered interest parity (UIP)

> Assume investor accepts risk involved and purchases with E(F) in mind. 

---

# FX Market: CIP

<br>
--

Investors will trade until returns from either bond equalize, and .hi-pink[all arbitrage opportunities are exhausted].


--

$$\text{CIP}: (1+i) = (1+i^*)\frac{F_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}$$

--

In that case, investors are .hi-pink[indifferent] between either bond since their real returns are the same. 

--

Allows us to pin down the $F$ necessary to achieve CIP
$$F_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}} = R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}} \frac{1+i}{1+i^*}$$


---

# FX Market: UIP

This alternative method of investment allows us to determine how spot rates are established. 

--

The no-arbitrage condition for UIP is written as follows:

$$\text{UIP}: (1+i) = (1+i^*)\frac{E(F)_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}$$

--

Allows us to pin down the $R$ necessary to satisfy UIP
$$R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}} = E(F)_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}} \frac{1+i^*}{1+i}$$
--

We can calculate today's spot rate if we know market expected exchange rate and these two respective interest rates. 


---

# Evidence of UIP

<br>


Taking both our previous equations, and dividing one into the other on __both sides__.

$$\text{CIP}: (1+i) = (1+i^*)\frac{F_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}\\
\text{UIP}: (1+i) = (1+i^*)\frac{E(F)_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}},\\
\implies 1 = \frac{F_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{E(F)_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}$$

--

Under the assumption of both types of investors (risky and riskless) exhausting all arbitrage opportunities, expected exchange rates should be equal to forward exchange rates.

---

# Evidence of UIP

<br>

For both relationships to hold, these items _must be equal to one another empirically_. 

--

_In equilibrium_, if investors do not care about risk, then they have no reason to prefer to avoid risk by using the forward market rate. 


--

Using previous equation, test described as checking whether the .hi-pink[expected rate of depreciation] is equal to the .hi-pink[forward premium]

$$\underbrace{\frac{F_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}-1}_{\text{Forward Premium}} = \underbrace{\frac{E(F)_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}{R_{\text{USD}/\text{EUR}}}-1}_{\text{Expected Rate of Depreciation}}$$
