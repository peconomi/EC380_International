# Prologue

### Last Time

* Countries with no absolute advantage in production can still trade in both Ricardian and HO models

* In HO case, advantages are driven by abundancies in different factors which vary across countries

--

* While Ricardian trade openness gains for everyone, HO highlights a .hi-pink[reallocation] of resources across industries that may disadvantage the main factor of the now import-reliant sector

--

### Today


* Specific Factors model, Model Empirics &amp; Extensions



---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;


.hi-pink[Short run]: factor mobility between industries is limited (e.g. repurosing a large piece of factory machinery to production of another specialized good).

--

Same true for labor.

--

Suppose world prices adjust and resources begin leaving the US steel industry. 

--

In long run, they may retrain and find employment elsewhere but in short run they are stuck with pay cuts and potential unemployment. 

---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;

--

To address ability of production factors to reallocate across domestic industries, and incorporate  .hi-pink[heterogeneity across time], lets add conditions to the .hi-pink[HO model].

--

* Three factors: land, labor, capital

* Two goods: steel and bread

* `\(Q_{s} = f(K,LB)\)` and `\(Q_{b} = f(LB,LD)\)`

--

Labor is our .hi-pink[variable factor] that varies in use between both goods.
LD and K are .hi-pink[specific factors] because they are exclusively used for specific goods. 

---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;

Modifying the .hi-pink[HO model] slightly, we have now extended it into a .hi-pink[specific factors model].

--

Each good produced with a using a unique specific factor. Variable factor used for both.

--

Specific factors are .hi-pink[immobile] and cannot move between the two industries while the variable factor is .hi-pink[mobile].


---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;

---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;

With each model we face, trade patterns are always determined by .hi-pink[comparative advantage].

--

Who has the edge in which good in this model? 

--

As with .hi-pink[HO], this will be determined by factor endowments but critical role is now played by the specific factors. 

--

For the two goods, they will present different needs for combinations for labor and each industry-specific factor. 

--

.hi-pink[Comparative advantage] for the industry of which the specific factor is relatively more abundant.

---

# Specific Factors Model

&lt;br&gt;

--

Recall logic of comparative advantage .hi-pink[always comes back to opportunity cost.]

--

Ireland well-endowed with land, relative to the UK (high pop density). 

--

Since Ireland land-abundant, the opportunity cost of an additional unit of bread production is __lower__ than it is in the UK.

--

In other words, one additional loaf of bread costs less losses in terms of the capital-intensive good's output relative to the UK.

--

What does that imply about the UK's comparative advantage and its primary specific factor that determines this advantage?


---

# Specific Factors Model: Income

--

&lt;br&gt;

How does switching from autarky to an open economy impact the .hi-pink[income distribution]?

--

* Each country expands production into industry reliant on specific factor that country is __relatively__ abundant in

--

* Demand shrinks for the __scarce__ specific factor of each economy

--

* Ireland would cut back on capital-intensive good, capital owners in Ireland are hurt by lower income generated from leasing capital

---

# Specific Factors Model: Income

--

&lt;br&gt;

In contrast, Irish landowners are delighted. Per unit returns on renting land are now higher due to greater domestic demand. 

* UK sees opposite effect 

* UK capital owner income rises and UK landowner income falls


--

Labor outcomes are indeterminate. It depends on whether labor shares of income generated were higher in the land-industry or capital-industry for each country. 

---

# Specific Factors Model: Income

&lt;br&gt;

--

From price perspective:

* Land-good demand rises in Ireland, since world price is higher than autarky price of bread. Capital-intensive good's price falls relative to autarky.

--

* From UK perspective, the capital-intesive good's price has risen and land-intensive good's price falls.

--

Net effects of for labor, following these price changes to world prices, are ambiguous and depend on consumption patterns. 


---

# Empirical Tests

--

So far we have argued these points on trade gains based exclusively on theory. 

--

You should always ask yourself two questions:

--

1. Do the predictions of a generalized model hold in the data?

--

2. Are there other reasons these predict patterns may be observed in the data?

--

A great deal of work from economists works towards translating theory into empirical analysis

--

For example, .hi-pink[Blonigen &amp; Wilson (2008)] examines whether port efficiency allows for greater volumne of trade
 

---

# Empirical Tests: Comparative Adv.

&lt;br&gt;

--

All trade theories boil down to differences between countries establishing .hi-pink[comparative advantages] and motivating trade.

--

Each theory predicts which goods a country will import and export.

--

Empirical tests of trade are difficult due to our inability to observe an .hi-pink['autarky' counterfactual] and difficulty in .hi-pink[measuring factor endowments]. 

--

Rather than going between extremes of no-trade to completely free trade, we normally imagine changes in .hi-pink['trade openness'] as a result of :

* Lower tariff rates and reduced trade quotas


---

# Empirical Tests: Comparative Adv.

&lt;br&gt;

--

.hi-pink[Ricardian Model]: Challenging to test due to relative differences in technology, which augment labor productivity, being hard to interlink. 

--

.hi-pink[HO Model]: Even harder to apply tests for given the challenges involved in accurately measuring factor endowments. Our measures of land and capital values are imprecise estimates.

--

As a result, Ricardian models have been more frequently and successfully tested. 

--

.hi-pink[Findings]: As labor productivity in a particular industry rises, the intensive margin by which goods are export are exported increases. Country becomes a net exporter of that good. 


---

# Empirical Tests: Comparative Adv.

&lt;br&gt;

--

Tests of HO are more mixed. 

--

Cross-country measures of capital, land and labor endowments are often measured using different means due to .hi-pink[methodological differences] across various national accounting bodies. 

--

For example, housing's contribution to CPI is based on mortgage values in Europe while the US uses a rental equivalence approach. 

--

.hi-pink[McQuinn et al. (2018)] highlights that these differences in methodological approaches can have severe consequences for the resulting inflation index. 


---

# Empirical Tests: Comparative Adv.

&lt;br&gt;

So how do we address international economic theories when countries are all measuring our key statistics in different manners? 

--

This normally requires an NGO or world body to apply data collection methods in a cross-country manner.

--

For example, data from .hi-pink[Enterprise Surveys] provided to me by the World Bank yields firm-level data on capital holdings, labor expenditure, land ownerships, sales, as well as trade activity. 

--

This has allowed me to address how .hi-pink[corruption] acts as a barrier to trade activity at the firm level and, in turn, limit nations' gains from trade. 

---


# Empirical Tests: Comparative Adv.

&lt;br&gt;

--

Other differences between countries, beyond technology and factor endowments, explain differences in trade flows across countries.

--

* Economies of scale

* Corporate structures

* Economic policy

* Public infrastructure

* Institutional quality


---

# Extensions to Trade Theory

&lt;br&gt;

--

Given these empirical concerns and other key country-level differences, further extensions to HO have been developed.

--

.pull-left[
* Gravity Model
]

--

.pull-right[
* Trade vs FDI
]

--

.pull-left[
* Product Cycle
]

--

.pull-right[
* Offshoring &amp; outsourcing
]

&lt;br&gt;

--

Each of these theoretical settings explains a portion of existing trade. 


---

# Extension: Gravity Model

&lt;br&gt;

--

To explain how a country trades with other countries, we must factor in distance and GDP.

--

- The .hi-pink[larger] the other country is, the more demand it represents on the global market for our given good

- The .hi-pink[closer] that other country is, the cheaper it is to access that market

--

Many empirical analyses leverage model specifications on these key factors, which explain much of the variation observed in country-level trade flows. 


---

# Extension: Product Cycle

&lt;br&gt;

--

Developed by Raymond Vernon, explains exports of sophisticated manufactured goods from countries scarce in  skilled labor and capital. 

--

.hi-pink[HO model] would be scratching its head over this phenomenon.

--

Many manufactured goods go through product cycle where .hi-pink[factor inputs change over time]. 

--

At these early stages, product components change often and require proximity to market of demand for updates/changes.

--

Developing and experimenting on new components takes considerably sosphisticated capital and highly skilled labor. 

---

# Extension: Product Cycle

--

Over time, product incorporates less adjustments to design. 

--

Can be consistently produced without further value-added contributions from .hi-pink[development phase] factors of production. 

--

.hi-pink[Standardized phase] begins and production contributions are increasingly stemming from unskilled labor factor. 

--

In the .hi-pink[late phase] of the product cycle, when consumption exceeds local production, costs are kept low by moving out production to other countries specialized in providing unskilled labor services 

--

Composition of factor inputs changing over time leads to relocation of production efforts, increasingly towards unskilled labor setting. 

---

# Extension: Trade/FDI

--

In .hi-pink[product cycle] argument, firms invest abroad and some output generated is sent home for consumption.

--

This pattern differs greatly from .hi-pink[HO], where no investment abroad is accounted for and factor endowments cannot cross countries. 

--

.hi-pink[FDI]: This theory suggests cases may exist where firms elect to .hi-pink[invest abroad] rather than ship goods abroad.

--

.hi-pink[Intrafirm trade]: It also suggests output shipped from foreign affiliate back home is handled under one firm's umbrella.

--

&gt; IE: By the mid-90s, `\(\frac{1}{3}\)` of US goods exports and `\(\frac{2}{5}\)` of US goods imports attributed to intrafirm trade.

---

# Extension: Trade/FDI

&lt;br&gt;

--

.hi-pink[Why do some firms set up foreign operations instead of buying imports directly from foreign firm? Why do some firms build factories abroad to sell in a foreign market, rather than just export to that market?]

--

There must be scenarios in which either choice is the profit maximizing decision, dependent on a choice set of key characteristics.

--

The product cycle theory would suggest low income countries should be hubs for FDI, but not the case in the data.  The greatest proportion of FDI goes .hi-pink[between developed nations].

--

Separate theory exists to explain this .hi-pink[proximity-concentration] trade-off, but beyond scope of this class. 

---

# Extension: Offshore/Outsource

&lt;br&gt;

--

.hi-pink[Offshoring]: Set up a plant abroad to make stuff.

--

.hi-pink[Outsourcing]: Contract a different enterprise to make stuff for you. Agreement can be international.  

--

Modernization of the trade process has made these .hi-pink[international features] of production and distribution chains more feasible.

--

Largely driven in the 1990s by internet availability, satellite communication, containerization of cargo and better computing power. 

--

Easier to succesfully manage business operations abroad (marginal cost of multinational enterprise operations lower).


---


# Extension: Offshore/Outsource

&lt;br&gt;

--

Effects include a trend towards international production, with comparative advantages across countries featuring in individual firms' supply chains. 

--

Rather an specialize in goods, countries can specialize in .hi-pink[key intermediate inputs].

--

Trade economists refer to this as increased formations of .hi-pink[global value chains]. 

--

Many exports and local production processes now rely on the availability of imports. .hi-pink[Huge vulnerability if ports become congested]. 


---

### To summarise:

* .hi-pink[Specific Factors Model] predicts gains and loses when switching from autarky to free trade

* Model empirics are supportive of .hi-pink[Ricardo model], but have mixed results for .hi-pink[HO model]

* Predictions of HO deviated from in data

* These differences can be explained by patterns in FDI that substitute for what would otherwise be trade flows
