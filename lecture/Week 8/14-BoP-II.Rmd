# Limits on Financial Flows


<br>

Last time we discussed financial account flows.

A .hi-pink[trade-off] exists with respect to allowing greater financial flexibility and increase exposure to international financial crises/capital flight.

--

* Countries risk becoming reliant on external sources of liquidity

* A quick change in the business cycle could result in a large-scale exodus of liquidity

* Asset prices drop, indebtedness intensifies



---


# National Accounts + Deficit

<br> .hi-pink[National income and product accounts (NIPA).]

--

_Gross domestic product_ .hi-pink[(GDP)]: value of all final goods and services produced inside its borders during some time period.

--

_Gross national product_ .hi-pink[(GNP)]: value of all final goods and services produced by the labor, capital, and other resources of a country, regardless of where production occurred

--

<br>

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + \text{foreign income received} - \text{income paid to foreigners} +\\ \text{foreign transgers received} - \text{transfers paid to foreigners}$$


---


# National Accounts + Deficit

<br>

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + (\text{Net Primary Income} + \text{Net Secondary Income})$$

--

Standard macro: $GDP = C+I+G+X-M$

# National Savings

# Current Account Deficit

# Investment Position
