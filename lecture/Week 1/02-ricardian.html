# Overview Trade Theory

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Why does trade occur?] Two strands within the field of international trade:

--

__I. Neoclassical models of trade__ ('old' theories):

- Ricardian model: Technology differences spur trade

- Heckscher-Ohlin model: Resource differences spur trade

--

__II. 'New' Trade Theory__

- Krugman model: Love of variety spurs trade

- Melitz model: Heterogenous firms drive trade


---

# Today's Class

&lt;br&gt;

We will begin looking into international trade theory, starting with the .hi-pink[Ricardo model].

* Single factor of production (labor)

* Two-country model (home, foreign)

* Technology differences across countries 

--

__To reiterate:__ Always remember to describe each model by three attributes, such as those listed above, and the model's main takeaway(s)!

---

# Snapshot of US imports

&lt;br&gt;

In 2018, the US imported approximately 28M USD in snowboards 

* Almost half of which were imported from China
* Austria, UAE and Taiwan were other notable sources

--

The US represents the largest economy in the world, yet it resorts to imports of goods at a level that far exceeds its exports. 

--

For example, while 99% of shipping containers that enter Los Angeles port are fully loaded with goods, _70% of containers leaving the port are empty_. 

---

# Reasons for Trade

&lt;br&gt;

With all the manufacturing capability in the US, why purchase snowboards from abroad instead of producing them domestically?

--

* Technology differences in each country? 
* Total resources available differ in each country?
* Production cost differences in each country?
* Proximity to countries with more productive labor forces?

--

For now, consider .hi-pink[opportunity cost]. According to the __Ricardian perspective__, the US devotes domestic labor that would otherwise be used to produce these snowboards to .hi-pink[comparatively] more productive tasks. 

---

# Comparative Advantage

&lt;br&gt;

During the 16th and 17th century, the study of economics was in its infancy. Misguided beliefs in public policy were widely held across nations.

--

&gt; Mercantilism: a stockpile of gold and silver was considered an appropriate barometer for the state of the domestic economy. 

&gt; Imports `\(\implies\)` less gold and exports `\(\implies\)` more gold.  Tariffs set high to prevent trade deficits.

--

Ricardo would go on to demonstrate that under .hi-pink[balanced free trade] (no tariffs), trade benefits __every country__. This is achieved when every country exports the goods they have .hi-pink[comparative advantage] in.  


---

# Comparative Advantage Overview

__Ricardo's logic:__

--

* Two countries, Portugal and England

--

* Two goods, wine and cloth

--

* Portugal has absolute advantage in production of both goods

--

* England is particularly bad at making wine, making it _relatively_ good at cloth production

--

England has .hi-pink[comparative advantage] in cloth. Portugal has .hi-pink[comparative advantage] in wine. 

--

Free trade puts both countries in a better state than autarky would.  

---

# Ricardian Model of Trade

--

&lt;br&gt;

We will go with our own version of the model. 

* Two countries, Home and Foreign
* Two goods, apple pie and potatoes
* One factor of production, labor

--

Suppose in our case the home country ends up exporting apple pies and importing potatoes.

--

.hi-pink[What would this imply about which good each country has comparative advantage in?]

---

# Key Variables

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Marginal Product of Labor]: MPL represents the additional units of a good produced, given a one unit increase in the number of workers assigned to a particular task.

--

`\(MPL^H_{\text{pie}}=9\)` and `\(MPL^H_{\text{potato}}=7\)` represent the marginal change in number of pies and potatoes produced by the home country as the number of workers rises by one unit. 

--

Essentially boils down to how "good" each country is per unit of worker. 

--

`\(MPL^F_{\text{pie}}=10\)` and `\(MPL^F_{\text{potato}}=12\)` for Foreign with .hi-pink[absolute advantage]&lt;br&gt; 

---

# Key Variables

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Production Possibilities Frontier]: Coordinates represent various production bundles of pies and potatoes for each country is capable of producing, upon using its full labor force `\(\bar{L}=10\)`.

--

We can plot these rather easily by finding the .hi-pink[four axes intercepts]. Each country-good marginal product of labor times the workforce size `\(MPL^{\text{country}}_{\text{good}} * \bar L\)`

--

In our case this leads to...

--

`$$\implies \bar{\text{Q}}^{H}_{pie} = 9*10=90, \ \ \ \ \bar{\text{Q}}^H_{\text{potato}}=7*10=70\\
\implies \bar{\text{Q}}^{F}_{pie} = 10*10=100, \ \ \ \ \bar{\text{Q}}^F_{\text{potato}}=12*10=120$$`

---

# PPF Scenario

&lt;img src="02-ricardian_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# PPF Scenario


__Assumption:__ PPFs straight due to constant MPLs 

__Slope of PPF:__ equal to the marginal rate of substitution between potatoes and pies. 

`$$\text{Slope of PPF}^{H} =  - \frac{70}{90} = - \frac{MPL^H_{\text{potato}}*\bar L}{MPL^H_{\text{pie}}*\bar L} = - \frac{MPL^H_{\text{potato}}}{MPL^H_{\text{pie}}} = - \frac{7}{9}$$`

--

.hi-pink[Opportunity cost] measured by slope of  PPF. For `\(\Delta Q^H_{\text{pie}}=1\)`, this would come at the cost of less potatoes being produced `\(\implies \Delta Q^H_{\text{potato}} = -\frac{7}{9}\)`.

--

`\(\frac{7}{9}\)` bags of potatoes is the .hi-pink[opportunity cost] of obtaining 1 more apple pie and the slope of the PPF for Home. 


---

# Indifference Curve

&lt;br&gt;

--

* PPF: whole set of possible production outcomes, all use the entire workforce
* Any production bundle below the PPF line is suboptimal, utilizes `\(L&lt;\bar L\)`
* Which of these max bundles do we choose?

--

Depends on home's demand for the two goods. Each .hi-pink[indifference curve] shows consumption bundles of goods that economy can consume and be equally satisfied.

--

The consumer is __indifferent__ in its own preferences across the consumption bundles listed on a particular indifference curve. 

---

# Indifference Curve

&lt;img src="02-ricardian_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Indifferent between A and B and prefers any point on `\(I_2\)` to `\(I_1\)`.


---

#  Home Equilibrium

&lt;br&gt;

Suppose we are in .hi-pink[closed economy] where Home PPF acts as a budget constraint.

IC of Home's consumers tangent to PPF at __(36, 42)__.

Home consumes 36 pies and 42 potatoes under autarky. 

--

Underlying assumption of .hi-pink[perfectly comptetitive markets] such that goods are sold at cost. 

Given these resource constraints, this market generates the highest consumer welfare. 


---

# Opportunity Cost and Prices

&lt;br&gt;

* Slope of the PPF reflects the .hi-pink[opportunity cost] of producing one apple pie

--

* Under perfect competition the .hi-pink[opportunity cost] of should also equal the relative price of pie

--

* This follows from the economic principle that price reflects the .hi-pink[opportunity cost] of a good 

--

* We can now check that this equality between the .hi-pink[opportunity cost] and the relative price of wheat holds at point A.

---

# Wages


&lt;br&gt;

How do we solve for prices of potatoes and pies at Home under autarky?

--

* .hi-pink[Perfectly competitive market]: Workers hired until value of additional worker is equal to marginal cost of additional worker
* Value represents the price of the good sold times the marginal change in units of good produced
* Workers are paid the equivalent of their MPL times the price of that additional unit they produce


---

# Wages

&lt;br&gt;

Potato (pie) firms hire until wage equals `\(P_{\text{potato}} *MPL_{\text{potato}}\)` `\((P_{\text{pie}} *MPL_{\text{pie}})\)`

--

If we assume labor moves freely between markets, we can assume wages equalized across these industries. 

--

`$$P_{\text{potato}} *MPL_{\text{potato}} = P_{\text{pie}} *MPL_{\text{pie}}$$`
--

We can rearrange such that the price ratio is equal to the MPL ratio


`$$\frac{P_{\text{pie}}}{P_{\text{potato}}} = \frac{MPL_{\text{potato}}}{MPL_{\text{pie}}}$$`

Relative price of pies is equal to the opportunity cost of pies at the .hi-pink[no-trade equilibrium].
