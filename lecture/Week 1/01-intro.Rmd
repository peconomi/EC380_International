# Course Objectives

<br>

For this class we will:

--

* study baseline models explaining why countries trade 

--

* analyze policy-relevant trade tools (tariffs, quotas, subsidies)

--

* explore global finance through exchange rates and BoP 


---

# Course Objectives: Synergies

# International Trade:

## Key Facts

---

# Trade growth outpaces GDP growth

```{r, out.width="85%", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/1_trade_growth.png")

```

Recent slowdown in trade, which we will address

---

# Flows rising as share of GDP (US)

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/2_trade_share.png")

```

---

# Trade varies in importance

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/3_trade_scale.png")

```

Small open economies are highly reliant on trade. 

---

# Key Facts I

<br>

* Trade is important and increasingly so
* Flows represent a large portion of US GDP
* Trade openness varies across countries of different sizes

--

Questions arise:

* Why do countries trade so much and why is it growing in scale?
* What are the gains from trade?
* How does trade translate into other changes (e.g. labor market outcomes, geopolitical tensions)

--

.hi-slate[Part I] of this course will focus on the .hi-slate[theories of international trade]. By the time we are done, very generalized lessons will be available to us. 

---

# Introducing Theory

<br>

Main Questions:

* What goods do each country trade?

* How does trade affect product specialization?

---

# What goods do each country trade?

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/4_country_goods.png")

```

---

# Specialization and Compar. Advantage

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/5_product_year.png")

```


---

# Key Facts II


<br>

* Countries specialize and export core products

* Trading the goods that countries are "best" at producing results in _gains from trade_

--

What factors, other than fundamentals, influence specialization?

--

- Foreign direct investment (FDI)?

- Knowledge diffusion?

- Cross-border migration shocks?

---

# Why does trade continue growing?

<br>

Largely attributed to reduced trade barriers over time.

--

We refer to this process as .hi-slate[trade liberalization].

--

Examples include tariff rate reductions, preferential trade agreements and alleviating non-tarif measures (e.g. lower electronics quota for French imports to USA). 

--

__Since trade is not frictionless, do these frictions vary across countries?__


---

# Trade friction index

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/6_trade_index.png")

```

---

# Reduced Tariffs

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/7_tariffs.png")

```

---

# Lower Transport Costs

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/8_freight_rates.png")

```

---

# Key Facts III

<br>

* Explicit trade barriers have fallen over time, coinciding with the growth of trade relative to broad economic acivity

* Hidden barriers are the next hurdle, one which much of the literature suggests is far more impactful than existing tariff rates

--

Current trade theory and literature focuses on .hi-pink[heterogenous agent models], which was originally created to explain why not every firm functions as an exporter.

We __will not__ be going that deep into international trade, though I can recommend some texts for those interested in understanding the most modern forms of theory. 


---

# Overview Trade Theory

<br>

.hi-pink[Why does trade occur?] Two strands within the field of international trade:

--

__I. Neoclassical models of trade__ ('old' theories):

- Ricardian model: Technology differences spur trade

- Heckscher-Ohlin model: Resource differences spur trade

--

__II. 'New' Trade Theory__

- Krugman model: Love of variety spurs trade

- Melitz model: Heterogenous firms drive trade


---

# Next Class

<br>

We will begin looking into international trade theory, starting with the .hi-pink[Ricardo model].

* Single factor of production (labor)

* Two-country model (home, foreign)

* Technology differences across countries 

Going forward, try to describe each model by three attributes, such as those listed above, and the model's main takeaway(s)!
