# Prologue

# Recap

### Previously

* Quotas similar to tariffs but yield greater economic losses

* Domestic producers tend to prefer quotas to tariffs

* Not every non-tariff measure is considered protectionist

--

### Today

Trade agreements, joint policy outcomes and assessing recent history with our new knowledge

---

# Coordinating Trade Policy

<br>

Most countries are part of the .hi-pink[World Trade Organization] and adhere to a default non-discriminatory .hi-pink["Most Favored Nations"] (MFN) tariff rate schedule that applies to each country they trade with.

--

An exception to this norm is the use of these .hi-pink[regional trade agreements] which apply updated (reduced) tariffs to the set of parties included in an agreement.

--

* Free Trade Agreement

--


* Preferential Trade Agreements

--

* Customs Unions




---

# Free Trade Agreement

<br>

--

Consists of:

* Reduction or elimination of tariffs on qualified

--

* Intellectual Property Protection

--

* Harmonized Product Standards

U.S. has 14 FTAs with 20 countries which comprise about 40 percent of U.S. goods’ exports, with a main goal of .hi-pink[eliminating tariffs]

---

# Preferential Trade Agreements

<br>

Similar to an .hi-pink[FTA] but usually only focuses on the .hi-pink[reduction of tariffs] and covers a .hi-pink[narrower set of products]

--

A preferential trade agreement can also just be .hi-pink[unilateral] or for a particular amount of years.

--

The US maintains Preferential Trade Agreements with approximately 187 countries.

---

# Customs Union

<br>

Goes a step above and beyond. .hi-pink[Zero tariff rate] among member countries.

--

Standardized rates of customs duties on goods imported from other countries

* EU is a prevalent example of this system, introduced in 1960s

--

UK exit from the European Union and the Customs Union .hi-pink[changed rules] for British businesses doing business in Europe. Rare case of **reversal** of trade liberalization.


---

# Reversal: Brexit

--

Voted on in 2016, took 4 years of negotiation to enact.

.hi-pink[Effective date]: 31st January 2020

--

So if trade agreements lead to more trade and more trade boosts welfare, why did the UK reverse all the progress it made in .hi-pink[trade liberalization]?

--

```


---


# Reversal: Brexit

--

.hi-pink[How did negotiations go?]

--

Huge chaos throughout. UK assumed it would face continued free access to the EU single market due to its economic importance.

--

In reality, UK had derived about 13% of its GDP from exports to the EU, while conversely only 3% of the EU’s GDP derived from exports to the UK.

--

Although no tariffs are applied to trade, UK exporters have to prove they meet EU standards

* Was not previously necessary

* Leads to extra charges, taxes, paperwork and the halt of some exports to EU

---

# Reversal: Brexit

.hi-pink[How did negotiations go?]

One major hurdle: .hi-pink[1998 Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement]

--

* This earlier international agreement promises to keep open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland

* Infeasible if we need border control to check whether goods have appropriate documentation

--

* Compromise met by keeping NI in the European Single Market and allowing the Irish Sea to act as a trade border. 

--

* Goods are checked upon route between NI and rest of the UK. Politically sensitive decision for ardent UK supporters in NI.

# Unconventional Hidden Protection


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/reform_shipping.jpg")

```

---

# Unconventional Hidden Protection

Recent policy seeks to intervene with containerized trade in the US. Why?

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/empty_LA.png")

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/empty_NY.png")

```
]

---

# Unconventional Hidden Protection

<br>

--

Recently the Biden Administrative has signed into law the .hi-pink[Ocean Shipping Reform Act 2022]. This act features:

--

* Punish transport operators charging excessive demmurge fees

--

* Penalize companies denying vessel capacity allocations to US exporters

--

* Drive up data requirements from transport operators


--

All of these policies will translate into higher shipping costs for the average US importer. How would you expect this to affect trade outcomes? 

--

.hi-pink[Less imports narrow gains from trade.]

---

.hi-pink[In Summary]

* Quotas similar to tariffs but yield greater economic losses

* Domestic producers tend to prefer quotas to tariffs

* Not every non-tariff measure is considered protectionist

* Protectionism can and often does backfire

--

.hi-pink[Next time!]
