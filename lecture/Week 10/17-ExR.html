# Fixed Exchange Rates 

Several possibilities for setting the value of the country’s currency. 

--

One option is to keep the exchange rate constant, or __fixed__. 

--

Also called .hi-pink[pegged exchange rate] systems.

--

Small countries often give up control over their currency and adopt the currency of another country, usually the dollar or the euro. 

--

More commonly, the value of a nation’s money is set equal to a fixed amount of another country’s currency, or less commonly to a basket of several currencies. 

--

If the exchange rate is not allowed to vary, then it is called a .hi-pink[hard peg]. 

---

# Fixed Exchange Rates

&lt;br&gt;

Fixed exchange rates that fluctuate within a set band are .hi-pink[soft pegs] and these, in turn, can take several forms depending on the amount of variation allowed.

# Gold Standard

&lt;br&gt;

Historically, fixed exchange rates were the norm, often within framework that defined the value of a country’s currency in terms of a .hi-pink[fixed amount of gold]. 

--

After WWII, many nations shifted away from gold and pegged the value of their currencies to the USD.

--

During 1970s, use of .hi-pink[flexible exchange rate systems] increased, mostly in high-income industrial economies.

--

Many developing countries adopted flexible systems in the 1980s and 1990s, easily managed with advent of the computer and internet. 

---

# Gold Standard

&lt;br&gt;

There is no best exchange rate system. 

--

Currently, less than half of the world’s nations have flexible exchange rates.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Gold standards] are one type of fixed exchange rate. 

--

Abandoned nearly everywhere in 1930s during the Great Depression.

--

Restored in a modified form after WWII but has completely disappeared since the 1970s. 


---

# Gold Standard

&lt;br&gt;

Economists overwhelmingly opposed to return of gold standard, first countries to end gold standard were first ones to escape .hi-pink[Great Depression]. 

--

After WWII, Western economies adopted a modified gold standard under the .hi-pink[Bretton-Woods exchange rate system] (1947–1971).

--

&lt;br&gt;

Abandoned in the early 1970s. Gold standards highlight a pure form of fixed exchange rate with a hard peg.


--

Under pure gold standard, nations keep .hi-pink[gold as international reserve]. 

---

# Gold Standard

Gold used to settle most international obligations, and nations must be prepared to trade it for their own currency whenever foreigners attempt to “redeem” the home currency.

--

In this sense, the nation’s money is backed by gold.

--

There are essentially .hi-pink[three rules] that countries must follow in order to maintain a gold exchange standard.

--

* Must fix value of their currency unit in terms of gold.

* Keep supply of domestic money fixed in some constant proportion to their supply of gold. 

* Nations must stand ready and willing to provide gold in exchange for their home country currency

---

# Gold Standard

&lt;br&gt;

If a country _decided to print large quantities of money_ for which there is no gold backing.

--


* Purchases of domestically produced goods would rise.
 
* Would cause domestic prices to rise leading to foreign goods becoming more attractive. 

--
 
As imports in the home country increase, foreigners accumulate an unwanted supply of the home country’s currency. 

--

This is the point at which gold standard would begin to become unhinged. 


---

# Gold Standard

&lt;br&gt;

If gold supplies low relative to supply of domestic currency, gold reserves will begin to run out at some point. 

--

This spells crisis and a .hi-pink[possible end to the gold standard].

--

Under a .hi-pink[fixed exchange rate system], the national supply and demand for foreign currencies may vary but the nominal exchange rate cannot.

--

It is the responsibility of the monetary authorities to keep the exchange rate fixed. 

---

# Fixed ExR Policy Action


Suppose US &amp; UK both on gold standard and the US demand for GBP `\(\uparrow\)`.

--

&lt;img src="17-ExR_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

# Fixed ExR Policy Action

Policymakers must counter weakening dollar and keep `\(R_{\text{USD per GBP}}\)` fixed.

&lt;img src="17-ExR_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Fixed ExR Policy Action

&lt;br&gt;

There are two possibilities for the home country as it sells its gold reserves. 

* Demand for gold satisfied and pressure on its currency eases

* Begins to run out of gold (coffers too light). 

&lt;br&gt;

--

If the latter happens, the home country may be forced into a devaluation that is accomplished by changing the gold price of its currency. 

---

# Fixed ExR Policy Action

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Pegged exchange rate systems] operate similarly to gold standard except that instead of gold, another currency is used to “anchor” home currency.

--

* Exposed to policies of external third party. 

* Thailand pegged its currency to USD for many years. 

* If Japan and China devalue against the dollar, also devalued against Thai currency, and Thai exports suddenly less competitive. 

--

The simplest way to avoid is peg to a group of currencies. Reduces the importance of any single country’s currency. 

---

# Fixed ExR Policy Action

&lt;br&gt;

Countries that use a .hi-pink[crawling peg] may peg to a single currency or a basket of currencies, but they regularly adjust the exchange rate. 

--

The changes in the peg may occur on a daily basis by a predetermined amount. 

--

May prevent some country-specific problems with a fixed rate but difficult to manage and has been associated with numerous exchange rate crises.

* Effect of `\(\Delta S, \Delta D\)` of foreign currency on home currency

# Real Exchange Rate

&lt;br&gt;

ExR used so far does not really tell us what a foreign currency is worth. 

--

We still do not know the .hi-pink[purchasing power] of our domestic money when it is converted to a foreign currency. 

--

Suppose USD–Malaysian ringgit exchange rate is 0.25 USD per ringgit, constant over the year. 

--

Suppose Malaysian inflation is __4%__ and US inflation __1%__. 

--

After one year, 4 ringgits that cost one dollar will buy __3% less in Malaysia than the dollar buys in the United States__. 

---



# Real Exchange Rate


Higher inflation in Malaysia erodes the value more rapidly than at home. 

--

Converted to ringgits, .hi-pink[real purchasing power] of the dollar has declined even though the exchange rate is still 0.25 USD per ringgit.

--

For foreign exchange participants, key item of interest is .hi-pink[purchasing power] upon conversion, not nominal units of a foreign currency. 

--

US importer deciding between Malaysian and Chinese textiles does not really care if she gets four ringgits per dollar or eight Chinese yuan per dollar.

--

_Volume of textiles that can be purchased in Malaysia with four ringgits and in China with eight yuan is the only thing that matters._


---

# Real Exchange Rate

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Real ExR] is market exchange rate adjusted for price differences. 

--

Let’s consider case of a cheese vendor who is trying to decide whether to stock her shop with Italian or  locally produced cheese. 

--


Suppose say that a wheel Italian cheese of a given quality costs __200 EUR__ and American cheese of the same quality costs __180 USD__. 

--

Suppose that the nominal exchange rate is __1.20 USD per euro__ so that __180 USD__ is equivalent to __150 EUR__. 

--

Italian cheese costs one-third more than American cheese, .hi-pink[real ExR] is __1.33 wheels__ of American cheese per wheel of Italian cheese.


---

# Real Exchange Rate

&lt;br&gt;

Algebra:

`$$\text{Real ExR} \\
=[(\text{R} \times \text{Foreign Price})]/ (\text{Domestic Price})\\
=[(1.20 \text{ per EUR}) \times (200\text{ EUR per wheel})]/( 180 \text{ USD per wheel})\\
=\frac{(240 \text{ USD per wheel of Italian Cheese})}{(180 \text{ USD per wheel of American cheese})}\\
= 1 \frac{1}{3} \text{ wheels of American cheese per wheel of Italian cheese}$$`


--

.hi-pink[Whether wine or cheese, process is the same, as you'll see in your homework.]

---

# Real Exchange Rate

&lt;br&gt;

`$$R_r = R_n (P^*/P)$$`

--

The real rate equals the nominal rate when the price levels (purchasing powers) are the same in both countries.

--


For example, consider the current USD-EUR exchange rate, along with their price levels: `\(R_r = (1 \text{ USD per EUR}) \times (109.1/108.5)\)` 


--

Even though we express parity in EUR to USD, .hi-pink[real exchange rates] suggest appreciated EUR value and slightly greater buying power with the dollar due to lower inflation.  


---

# Choosing Exchange Rate System

&lt;br&gt;

Active area of economic research has focused on performance characteristics of systems under different economic conditions and institutional arrangements. 

--

Researchers have become more concerned with understanding how varying degrees of .hi-pink[flexibility] or .hi-pink[fixity] might best serve the interests of individual countries. 

--

How do different systems influence core elements of a country’s macroeconomy?

---

# Choosing Exchange Rate System

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Traditional view]: Countries with fixed exchange rate systems were better at controlling inflation but paid a price in the form of slower economic growth. 

--

Governments have to be very careful about issuing new money. Exchange rate policy that limits the supply of money would also help avoid inflation. 

--

Limits placed on ability to manipulate money supply also remove an important monetary policy tool tused to manage economic growth.


---

# Choosing Exchange Rate System

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Research has failed to demonstrate a strong relationship between the type of exchange rate system and either inflation or economic growth.]

--

Before 90s, countries .hi-pink[pegged exchange rates] associated with lower inflation, but during the 90s the differences disappeared. 

--

Countries with .hi-pink[flexible rates] have higher average rates of economic growth, but result depends on classification of the fastest growing Asian economies. 

--

When they omit countries who manage flexible rates, no significant difference in growth between countries with relatively fixed and relatively flexible rates. 


---

# Choosing Exchange Rate System

Neither fixed nor flexible rates offer superior protection against a currency crisis. 

--

_No particular system_ seems to rank above any other in its ability to provide superior macroeconomic performance.

--

If the goal set to minimize negative shocks to an economy, then .hi-pink[source of the shock] determines which system should be adopted. 

--

If originates in monetary sector (printing new money), fixed rate is better since it imposes discipline on the central bank. 

--

If originates in the external environment (oil shock), relatively more flexibility enables the country to adapt more easily.

# Single Currency Areas

&lt;br&gt;

Jan-1999, 11 members of EU .hi-pink[adopted euro] as their official currency. 

--

As the EU added new members, several chose to use the euro, and as of 2016, .hi-pink[19 of 28 members] had replaced their national currencies with the euro. 

--

Shared vision developed economic interdependence and prevent future war. 

--

Nation’s currency is one of its strongest symbols of national sovereignty, remarkable set of events.

---

# Single Currency Areas

&lt;br&gt;


Four potential reasons why countries might want to share a common currency. 

--

* Eliminates need to convert money, reduces transaction costs. Some gain in efficiency. 


* Eliminates price fluctuations caused by changes in the exchange rate.

* Can help increase political trust between countries seeking to increase their integration. 

--

Nations that give up their national money do not do so without cost. 

---

# Single Currency Areas

Adoption of a .hi-pink[common currency] also means that the country no longer has its own .hi-pink[money supply as a tool] for managing its economic growth. 

--

* If control money supply, can influence growth of economy in the short run thru change in money supply.

* Hard for monetary policy of single currency to implement interest rates that suit every member state perfectly. 

* Countries give up their ability to alter their exchange rates. 

* Expected to implement policies aimed at pushing down prices and wages inside their countries and do not have the option to devalue currencies to make goods cheaper. 


---

# Single Currency Areas

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Conditions for adoption of single currency]

--

* Business cycle must be synchronized 

--

* High degree of labor and capital mobility between the member countries

--

* Regional policies capable of addressing the imbalances that may develop

--

* Nations involved must be seeking a level of integration that goes beyond simple free trade
