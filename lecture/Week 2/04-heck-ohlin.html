# To Recap

### Last Time

* Countries with no absolute advantage in production can still trade!

--

* Since then, the .hi-pink[internet] and subsequent .hi-pink[information age] have largely narrowed differences in technology

--

* .hi-pink[What else helps us understand what drives our need to trade goods?]

--

### Today


.hi-slate[Hechscher-Ohlin Model] suggests differences in factor endowments can explain trade patterns


---

# Hechscher-Ohlin Model

&lt;br&gt;

--

We will go with our own version of the model. 

* Two countries, Home and Foreign
* Two goods, steel and cloth
* .hi-pink[Two] factors of production, labor and .hi-pink[capital]

--

Suppose in our case the home country ends up exporting apple pies and importing potatoes.

--

.hi-pink[What would this imply about which good each country has comparative advantage in?]


---

# Hechscher-Ohlin Model

--

__Key terms:__

--

.hi-slate[Factor abundance]: Relative measure, where if particular factor `\(x\)` represents a large share of total factors, country is `\(x\)`-factor abundant. 

.hi-slate[Factor scarcity]: Country has less of a particular factor relative to other factors or in comparison to another country. 

--

The .hi-pink[capital-labor ratio] is a comment tool of comparison for assigning countries into resource endowment groups. 

--

The higher `\(K/L\)` is for a given country, relative to others, the more capital-abundant it is. 

---

# Hechscher-Ohlin Model

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;  &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Ireland &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; United Kingdom &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Capital &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90 Tractors &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 150 Tractors &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Labor &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 300 Farmers &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 400 Farmers &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;

.hi-pink[Which country is capital-abundant?]

--

`$$\frac{K_{IRL}}{L_{IRL}} = 0.3, \ \ \ \frac{K_{UK}}{L_{UK}} = 0.375$$`


---

# Hechscher-Ohlin Model

### Production Costs

&lt;br&gt;

--

The ratio between capital and labor implies .hi-pink[abundancy]. Countries where a given factor is relatively .hi-pink[more abundant] exhibit .hi-pink[lower input prices] per unit of the factor. 

--

The labor-abundant country finds labor to be relatively cheaper, per unit, than the capital-abundant country.

--

HO: Labor-abundant country has a .hi-pink[comparative advantage] due to its edge the cost of production of .hi-pink[labor-intensive goods]. 

---

# Hechscher-Ohlin Model

### Production Costs

&lt;br&gt;

--

Since the US is .hi-pink[capital-abundant], it faces relatively cheaper capital and faces a lower opportunity cost in production that uses relatively more capital.

--

This may explain US trade patterns in which .hi-pink[capital-intensive] exports of jet engines and agricultural products dominate its goods outflows. 



---

# Gains from Trade

--

&lt;br&gt;

Ricardian model assumed a single factor `\(\implies\)` all countries face same trade-off regardless of input levels.

--

HO model now considers combinations of factors, where some specific combination of two is most productive. 

--

.hi-pink[How does this affect our visualization?]

Production possibilities frontier (PPF) will be curved instead of straight. 

---

# New PPF

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# New PPF

&lt;br&gt;

As you can see, adjustments at the tailend of these frontiers require a disproportionately large exchange on equipment.  

--

Opportunity costs are .hi-pink[rising] for each type of production. 

--

Each unit increase in the labor-good leads to an increasingly sizeable loss of the other unit. 

--

.hi-pink[Why?]

As you reallocate resources from a capital-intensive good to labor-intensive, you need greater amounts of factors due to factor combinations being misaligned. 


---

# Gains from Trade: Autarky

--

.hi-slate[Closed economy scenario:] Consider a case in which the US does __not__ trade. 

In absense of trade, Home consumes exactly what it produces. 

--

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;br&gt;

--

Upon opening up trade and facing no trade costs, the world PPF is now the item of material interest.

--

The previous relative prices of goods changes to a .hi-pink[world relative price]. This identifies the slope of the CPC described in IE Ch. 4.2.2. 

--

Given that this line is not tangental to the production possibility frontier, there are other bundles of goods that reach higher indifference curves `\(U_i\)`. 

--

In our case, Home reaches `\(U_2\)` by reallocating production away from textiles and towards manufacturing, given that Home is a capital intensive nation. 

---

# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---


# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.svg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Gains from Trade: Free Trade

&lt;br&gt;

--

Since we are trading at .hi-pink[world price level], we can reach .hi-pink[higher] indifference curves.

--

We .hi-pink[produce at B] and .hi-pink[consume at C] at Home country.

--

Therefore if we produce more .hi-pink[manufacuturing output] than we consumer, we must be .hi-pink[exporting] a subset of these goods (difference between B outcome and C outcome). 

--

In contrast, we produce less .hi-pink[textiles] than we consume, suggesting that Home is .hi-pink[importing] the difference.

---

# Comparing to Ricardian Model

--

.hi-pink[Why B?]

We must produce where the opportunity cost of producing a manufactured good is equal to the relative world price slope (CPC). 

--

Our notion of trade gains are pretty similar to Ricardian views, but specialization is not complete due to .hi-pink[diminishing marginal productivty] associated with each factor. 

--

.hi-pink[Diminishing marginal productivty]: Holding your other factor fixed, the marginal unit increase of a given factor yields increasingly smaller contributions to overall output. 

---

# Comparing to Ricardian Model

&lt;img src="04-heck-ohlin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.svg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Imagine having one shovel to share between 5 workers. Sure they can exchange the shovel whenever they get tired, but including 10 more is going to make very little difference to total work output.


---

# Trade &amp; Income Distribution

--

In .hi-pink[Ricardian model] we ruled out harmful effects and suggest everyone benefits in society. 

--

Reallocated workers simply left and shrinking industry for an expanding one and were able to exchange their unchanged labor supply for a .hi-pink[larger bundle of goods]. 

--

The .hi-pink[HO model] takes a more moderate view


--

Rather than capital and labor, consider two labor sectors 

* Skilled

* Unskilled

Industries require different combinations of skilled and unskilled labor


---

# Heterogenous Income Effects

&lt;br&gt;

--

We will go into this further later into the course but for now keep in mind that trade openness can have heterogeneous effects depending on which part of the skill bracket a laborer belongs to. 

--

It can be shown that a systematic relationship exists between endowments of factors for a country and who ends up being these winners and losers.

--

I'll show  you a .hi-pink[theoretical argument] for how this can occur. Later we'll examine .hi-pink[empirical evidence], based on applied econometric analysis. 


---

# Stolper-Samuelson Theorem

&lt;br&gt;

Explains theoretical outcomes of assymetric factor outcomes. 

--

* Income depends on input supplied to value of final product

--

* Wages will vary based on their skill level

--

* Labor input earnings (wages) demand on their demand and supply

--

.hi-pink[Derived demand]: Demand for a good or service that is derived from demand for something else (e.g. demand for labor is based on demand for goods and services). 

---

# Stolper-Samuelson Theorem

&lt;br&gt;

Under high output demand, price is high and inputs used to produce benefit by receiving greater returns on their contribution.

--

Any change that impacts prices will have direct impacts on outcomes.

--

Open trade causes the .hi-pink[export good price] to rise and .hi-pink[import good price] to fall. Demand for each factor readjusts, leading to change in returns to each factor. 

--

Resources leave sector of imported good and enter sector of exported good, which cause changes in demand for each input in Ricardian model.

---

# Stolper-Samuelson Theorem

&lt;br&gt;

If manufacturing good is the export, demand for capital factor rises and demand for labor factor falls. 

--

This implies income for actors used intensively for the import sector fall and rises for the intensive factor of the export sector. 

--

.hi-pink[Stopler-Samuelson Theorem suggests that increase in price of good raises income earned by factors intensively used in its production. Fall in price of goods lowers income of factors used intensively.]

---

# Stolper-Samuelson Theorem

&lt;br&gt;

According to this __theory__, a country with a capital-intensive presence (e.g. USA) will shift away from labor demand.

Capital owners will benefit from trade. Laborers will lose out.

--

Read further into the .hi-pink[magnification effect]. This may come up in the future. 

---


# To Recap

* Countries with no absolute advantage in production can still trade in both Ricardian and HO models

* In HO case, advantages are driven by abundancies in different factors which vary across countries

--

* While Ricardian trade openness is a broad gain for everyone, HO highlights a .hi-pink[reallocation] of resources towards specific industries that may disadvantage the factor belonging predominantly to the now partially import-reliant sector.
