### International Financial Crises

<br>

* Defining types of international financial crises

--

* Vulnerabilities, Triggers and Contagion

--

* Crisis Control


--

* Post-Crisis Reform 


---

# Types

* Banking Crisis

> e.g. domino of bank collapse due to insolvency

--

* Exchange Rate Crisis

> e.g. unexpected collapse in value of developing country currency

--

* (Sovereign) Debt Crisis

> e.g. EU debt crisis following public bailouts

--

* Balance of Payments Crisis

> e.g. foreign currency reserves drying up 

---

# Banking Crises 

<br>

--

The primary role of a bank is to provide intermediation between .hi-pink[savers] and .hi-pink[borrowers].

--

* Pooled deposits saved in banks used as collateral to hedge loans for major businesses

--

* A functional banking systems is necessary to bolster investment by firms and homeowners

--

Some percentages of businesses fail, banks must compensate for these bad debts through gains made elsewhere, through elevated interest rates.



---

# Banking Crises 

<br>

--

Banking systems are reliant on interbanking lending channels

.hi-pink[Why?]

--

* No bank in particular has enough money to redeem every $ of deposits it maintains

--

* Some % of bank's liabilities returned to depositors every day

--

* In cases where a bank lacks cash, it can engage in .hi-pink[interbank lending]


--

A bank is considered .hi-pink[insolvent] if even after completely liquidizing its assets, it cannot repay its outstanding liabilities owed to creditors. 


---

# Banking Crises 

<br>

--


During a .hi-pink[banking crisis], an abnormally large % of borrowers fail to meet debts.

--

* Banks assets may suddenly deteriorate 

--

* Depositors may trigger a .hi-pink[run on banks]

--

If numerous banks struggle meeting obligations to their savers, major loss of savings. 

--

Remaining savings can be lost, causing households to reduce consumption. This can lead to ripple effects throughout the economy.

---

# Exchange Rate Crises

<br>

--

.hi-pink[Definition]: Sudden collapse of the value of national currency.

--

If seeking to peg another global currency, lack of foreign reserves may break fixed exchange rate. 

--

Devaluation similar to .hi-pink[bank run], international currency holders sell their holdings ASAP.

--

---

# Exchange Rate Crises

<br>

.hi-pink[What happens to the local economy?]

--

* Equivalent to available currency demand dropping significantly

--

* Suddenly foreign debt obligations hard to meet payments for $\implies$ potential knock-on bank crises

--

* Imported goods become expensive for local economy

--

* Indutries reliant on foreign credit suddenly see loss of liquidity, resulting in market price falls (e.g. housing market collapse)


---

# Debt Crises

<br>

--

.hi-pink[Definition]: Widespread failure to meet debt obligations.

--

* Can be public or private debtors that begin struggling to meet requirement debt repayments

--

* In exceptional cases out of borrower's control, debt forgiveness, interest rate and term length adjustments can be applied

--

* .hi-pink[External debt] is debt linked to a foreign lender/borrower. International exchanges of funds result in these forms of linkages.

--

If debt held in a specific currency, that country presides over legal matters related to payment arrears and bankruptcy. 

---

# Debt Crises

<br>

--

If a party fails to honor their debt, these losses can permuate throughout the rest of the economy. 

--

Widespread cases of failures to honor debt can lead to service providers declaring bankruptcy. 

--

.hi-pink[Spread can occur] in insolvency, in which other individuals go into bankruptcy because an intial set of individuals do.


---

# Debt Crises

--

Suppose economy is split into three groups;

* __Group A__ is heavily indebted and holding risky portfolio of assets it investment in

--

* __Group B__ holds relatively correlated assets to group A but maintains low debt level

--

* __Group C__ holds unrelated assets and maintains low debt level

--

If __A__ experiences a shock in which it cannot service its debts, it may be forced to sell all of its assets to meet as much of debt as possible.

--

__B__ sees .hi-pink[assets fall in value] as supply on market suddenly increases. 

--

__B__ assets fall in value $\implies$ becomes insolent too. Group C unaffected. 


---

# Debt Crises

--

Governments can also fail to obligate their debts. The EU debt crisis saw repeated episodes of .hi-pink[Greece] almost defaulting on debt, following major economic collapse.

<br>

--

.hi-pink[What happens when an entire country defaults on foreign debts?]


--

* Normally international lending agencies such as the .hi-pink[IMF] step in

--

* Bailouts are heavily politicized, often the distressed country is at the mercy of its neighbors

--

* Steep requirements can be placed on the burdened economy, extending the length of downturn to ensure bailout is provided

---


# BoP Crises

<br>

--

.hi-pink[Definition]: Country has a current account deficit that it cannot finance. 


--

<br>

Deficit is financed through selling financial assets, which includes currency reserves, as a way to generate .hi-pink[capital account net inflow] that offsets .hi-pink[current account net outflow]. 

--

* Foreign bankers extend loans, buy bonds, stocks or invest directly in deficit country's real estate market

--

* These flows must cover current accout deficit

---



# BoP Crises

<br>

--

If .hi-pink[deficit country] capital investments/purchases appear too risky, capital inflows ease.

--

As .hi-pink[Forbes and Warnock] reveal, patterns have emerged of these flows acting as sudden stops and surges

--

This can put great pressure on domestic reserves, causing them to dwindle.

--

Ability to purchase goods abroad using their denominated currency now faces a limit and may need to stop all together. 

--

Ability to convert local currency into foreign debt repayment transfers also kicks in, furthering stress on .hi-pink[deficit country]. 


---

```

# BoP Crises

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/forbes_fig_1.png")
```


--

Help from allies and IMF act as stopgaps to slow decline. Deficit must shrink until confidence in the country is restored.


---

# Vulnerabilities

--


.hi-pink[What are the origins of a given international crisis?]

--

Could be due to: 

* Macroeconomic imbalances

--

* Capital flow volatility

--

Long-run underlying issues for domestic economy may lead to over-reliance on foreign debt and over-leveraged credit status across households. 

Can be the result of either of these two scenarios. 


---

# Economic Imbalances

--


<br>

Macroimbalances can be attributes to: large budget deficits, large current account deficits, overinflated exchange rates, unsustainable private sector debt, speculative property bubbles. 

--

Normally these issue occur simultaneously, further complicating matters of unravelling macroeconomic imbalances.

--

.hi-pink[Poor fiscal policy] may lead to major public debt and high inflation domestically.

--

Doubt in government ability may result in government bond yields needing to rise to continue accessing foreign debt. Limits ability of government to service the economy. 


---

# Volatile Capital Flows

--

As .hi-pink[Warnock & Forbes (2012)] highlight, there is an ebb-and-flow to capital investment.

--

During good times, capital is situated in developed economies and accruing returns based on strong economy performance and high interest rates.

--

When developed economies enter recession, central banks .hi-pink[lower interest rates] and domestic economies see slump in consumption.

--

Capital investors .hi-pink[migrate] to low-income/emerging countries until resurgence in developed country economy.


--

These volatile movements of large sums of capital within these transition periods can be .hi-pink[highly costly for the emerging host countries].



---


# Contagion

<br>


.hi-pink[This aspect of crises determines the scale of how 'international' or 'cross-country' a given crisis will be.]

--

Particularly strong cases of interbank lending across countries make these spillovers of domestic shocks into foreign countries become amplified.

--

As the world becomes more globalized, financial interlinkages become stronger.

--

Local shocks are increasingly likely to trigger worldwide reprecussions due to greater degree of .hi-pink[financial interdependence.]


---

# Crisis Control (CC)

--

The financial sector has always been a concern for policymakers, due to the .hi-pink[too big to fail mindset].

--

* Bailouts of banks can protect economy, but greater risks offer greater returns

--

* Encourages banks to become large enough to .hi-pink[force bailouts] in between episodes of them over-leveraging themselves

--

This is defined as the .hi-pink[moral hazard problem] in which bankers are able to transfer high risks to the government and taxpayer. 

.hi-pink[Lets consider three measures a country can take to reduce exposure to financial crises]

---


# CC: Exchange Rate Policy

Avoidance of a .hi-pink[crawling peg exchange rate system] is often recommended.

--

* Regular devaluation of currency to stabilize .hi-pink[real exchange rate] in country with higher inflation than foreign partner

--

* If .hi-pink[domestic inflation higher than foreign], nominal devaluation keeps $R_r$ constant

--

* Requires monetary authority to restrict money creation, making it .hi-pink[anti-inflationary]

--

* Often leads to severe overvaluation of .hi-pink[real exchange rate], increasing vulnerability to crisis



---

# CC: Capital Controls

<br>


Capital volatility can be addressed by limiting how much capital enters and exits the country.

--

These .hi-pink[capital controls] are a popular policy tool in countries such as China. 


--

Can be attributed to reduced exposure to economic turmoil.

--


.hi-pink[Malaysia] enacted this policy during the Asian Financial Crisis in late 90's but failed to experience much of the warnings surrounding losses from poorer investor confidence. 

---

# CC: Policies


--

A budget deficit reduction may stem reserve losses and lower financial exposure.

--

Interest rate appreciation may boost demand for domestic currency, further helping.

--

.hi-pink[Macroeconomic imbalances can be relatively straightforward to address].

--

Political feasibility of these moves is up for question, hard to implement during economic strife. 

.hi-pink[Greek government was quickly voted out after agreeing to Germany/IMF austerity plans]


---

# International Reform

--

<br>

As a .hi-pink[lender of last resort] on the international scene, IMF is intervenes when countries reach crisis points and risk defaulting on international loans.

--

A great deal of focus has shifted to the .hi-pink[role of the IMF] and the .hi-pink[conditions it imposes] for bailout fund access. Issues include

--

* Moral Hazard Problem

--

* Limits to borrowing for countries

--

* Loans conditional on economic conditions



---

# Three Crises


<br>

* 1990s East Asian Financial Crisis

--

* 2008 Great Recession (Ireland)


--

* 2009 European Debt Crisis


---

# East Asian Crisis


<br>

__Leading Up__

* Private current account deficits in .hi-pink[Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia]

--

* Fixed exchange rate policy $\implies$ significant .hi-pink[external borrowing]

--

* US interest rate increases as period of pronounced growth began, USD value up

--

* Currency peg to USD $\implies$ suddenly exports are less competitive

--

* Huge capital drain to meet elevated .hi-pink[current account deficit]

---

# East Asian Crisis

<br>

__Crisis__

* Market panic, large withdrawal of credit from the crisis countries

--

* Triggered .hi-pink[series of bankruptcies] which would accelerate more capital flight

--

* Temporary policies to maintain peg were quickly exhausted (interest rate hike, domestic currency purchases)

--

* .hi-pink[Higher interest rates] further pressured these economies


---

# East Asian Crisis

<br>

__Response__

* The IMF offered bailout funds conditional on economic reforms, known as the .hi-pink[structural adjustment package]

--

> Required countries to reduce government spending and deficits, allow insolvent banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise interest rates.

--

* Critics noted the contractionary nature of policies

* In a recession the expected response was to increase government spending and yield greater liquidity through lower interest rates


---

# Great Recession (Ireland)

<br>

__Leading Up__

* In the early 2000's various EU member states at different points in business cycle

--

* .hi-pink[Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain] all experience boom periods

--

* A large proportion of interbank lending was channeling excessive Germany savings into these peripheral countries

--

.hi-pink[Irish banks became highly reliant on foreign borrowings] and offered excessive amounts of subprime mortgage loans





---


# Great Recession (Ireland)

<br>

__Crisis__

* Multiple property bubbles popping simulatenously across countries

--

* .hi-pink[Global lending channels] froze, channels Irish banks had become particularly reliant on

--

* Irish housing prices tanked, as did employment in construction sector

--

* .hi-pink[34,500 people] left the country from April 2009 to 2010, the .hi-pink[largest net emigration since 1989]



---

# Great Recession (Ireland)

<br>

__Response__

* Public bailout of banks, some failed others nationalized

--

* Irish .hi-pink[debt-to-GDP] rose rapidly to 120%

--

* Government required to implement .hi-pink[austerity measures] to receive bailout packages

--

* Macroprudential policy measures introduced to stabilize housing market



---

# EU Debt Crisis

<br>

.hi-pink[Ireland among many EU countries acquiring government debt]

--

* Widespread requirement of austerity plans

--

* International assymetry in business cycles combined with lax macroprudential rules prior to the crash

--

* More recently, countries are now held to macroeconomic monitoring with penalities imposed if countries allow their current account balances, inflation or GDP to get out of control
